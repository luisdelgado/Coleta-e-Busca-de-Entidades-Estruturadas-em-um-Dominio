            USAJOBS

            

                

                    

                        

                            1

                            

                                 Create a USAJOBS Profile

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            First, you need to create an account and complete your profile to apply to any job on USAJOBS.

                        

                        

                            With a USAJOBS account and profile you can save jobs, save and automate job searches, and manage everything you need to complete your application, including resumes and required documents.

                        

                    

                

                

                    

                        

                            2

                            

                                 Search for Jobs

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            Once you create your account, you can search for jobs.

                        

                        

                            It’s best to sign into your account before doing a search. Why? Because, we can use your profile information to improve your job search results.

                        

                        

                            You can also use filters such as location, salary, work schedule or agency to narrow your results.

                                 Review Job Announcement

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            If you find a job you’re interested in, read the entire announcement to determine if you’re eligible and meet the qualifications. It’s important to read the announcement, because there are required qualifications you must meet and include in your application.

                        

                    

                

                

                    

                        

                            4

                            

                                 Prepare your application in USAJOBS

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            Read the How to Apply section of the job announcement before starting your application. To start your application, click Apply and we'll walk you through a five-step process where you’ll attach a resume and any required documents.

                        

                        

                            During the application process you can review, edit, delete and update your information. We’ll automatically save your progress as you go, so you won’t lose any changes.

                        

                    

                

                

                    

                        

                            5

                            

                                 Submit application to agency

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            When your application is ready, you’ll be sent from USAJOBS to the agency application system and then you can submit your application. Before you submit, you may need to complete other agency-required steps such as a questionnaire or uploading additional documents.

                        

                        

                            The time it takes to submit an application depends on the job you are applying for and the agency's requirements.

                        

                        

                            You can check the status of your application in your USAJOBS account. When the agency receives your application, the status will change to "Received" which usually happens within a few hours after completion of your application. You may also receive an email confirmation from the agency application system, but not all agencies send emails.

                                 Agency reviews application

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            The hiring agency begins the review process when the job announcement closes. The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you're eligible and meet the qualifications for the position.

                        

                        

                            The hiring agency will place applicants into quality categories. Those placed in the highest category are sent to the hiring official. The application status of these applicants will change to "Referred". All other applicants (not being considered) will see a "Not Referred" status.

                        

                    

                

                

                    

                        

                            7

                            

                                 Interview

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            The hiring official will review the "highest qualified" applications and select the applicants to interview based on agency policy. The hiring agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews.

                        

                        

                            The interview can be a panel, in-person, video, or phone interview and there may be more than one interview round. For example, an applicant may have a phone interview and then an in-person interview.

                        

                        

                            It may take some time for an interview to be scheduled depending on the number of applicants being interviewed.

                                 Agency Selects Candidates

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            After all interviews are completed, the agency will select a candidate(s) and contact them to start the job offer process.

                        

                        

                            For those not selected, the hiring agency will update their application status to "Not Selected".

                                 Job Offer

                            

                        

                    

                    

                        

                        

                            The hiring agency will extend a tentative job offer contingent upon passing a background investigation. The background investigation will begin when the tentative offer is accepted. Additional security checks may be needed for a higher-level clearance.

                        

                        

                            The job offer is final when the background investigation and any additional security checks are successfully completed. The hiring agency will contact the candidate(s) directly to set up a start date.
